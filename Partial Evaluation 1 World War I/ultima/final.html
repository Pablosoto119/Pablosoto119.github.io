In 1917, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig (1861-1928) decided that the British Army would launch a major attack on the Ypres area. Circumstances were favorable for the operation. Britain was hit by a new German U-boat campaign, fought partly from ports on the Belgian coast. A British breakthrough at Ypres would allow an advance to the coast, eliminating these bases. (S. Jones, 2015)

The offensive launched by the British Fifth Army and Second Army against the German Fourth Army was seriously hampered by unusually heavy rains. The local drainage system had been destroyed in previous battles, and the battlefield became a swamp. Rain and mud seriously hampered the movement of people and goods. In this case, it is almost impossible for Britain to break through quickly. Instead, Third Ypres became a brutal war of attrition. The Battle of Passchendaele, fought on October 12, 1917 in a devastated, flooded area, was a painful and costly battle synonymous with the entire Third Battle of Ypres. (S. Jones, 2015)

Bad weather, limited progress and mounting casualties forced the British to call off the offensive in November. The outcome of the match is still controversial. Haig's offensive cost the British Army 244,897 men and failed to eliminate the German submarine threat. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George (1863–1945) condemned the operation as a "useless campaign". [1] However, although German troops held the line, the defenders suffered at least 217,194 casualties. (S. Jones, 2015)
