French and British troops were left occupying an exposed salient at the end of the First Battle of Ypres. The relative vulnerability of the Entente position meant that this sector of the front was characterized by incessant trench warfare.

In April 1915, the German Fourth Army, facing the British Second Army, several French divisions and Belgian troops, planned an attack on Ypres. It was primarily a strategic distraction to cover the German movement to the eastern front, so its objectives were strictly limited and did not include the capture of the city itself.

The attack would be supported by the first large-scale use of poison gas on the Western Front. The offensive began on April 22, and the new chemical weapons proved very effective. Due to the lack of protection against the poison gas, the Allied forces were surprised and suffered heavy losses. The overwhelming success of the initial attack clearly surprised the Germans, who quickly captured limited objectives but lost a rare opportunity to advance.

German forces had gained around two and a half miles of important ground<br> which further constricted the salient, but Entente forces retained control of Ypres.
